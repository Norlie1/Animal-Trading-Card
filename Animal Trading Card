			<p>The tiger, a formidable and majestic feline, is distinguished by its vibrant orange coat adorned with black stripes. As an apex predator, it primarily preys on species such as deer and wild boar. Tigers are solitary by nature and inhabit diverse ecosystems across Asia. However, they are increasingly threatened by habitat destruction and poaching, placing them in danger of extinction.</p>
